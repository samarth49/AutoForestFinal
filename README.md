# AutoForestFinal

AutoForestFinal is an advanced web-based system that combines cutting-edge image analytics and automation tools to assist in forest management. The platform is designed to detect and count trees, find optimal paths in forested areas, and automate plantation tasks using bots. It aims to simplify the management of forest areas, reduce human intervention, and promote sustainable practices.

## Features

- **Tree Detection and Counting**: Leverages satellite imagery and machine learning to accurately identify and count trees.
- **Optimal Pathfinding**: Utilizes AI-based algorithms to determine the most efficient paths in forested areas.
- **Automated Plantation**: Integrates bot-driven systems for planting trees, ensuring efficiency and precision using GPS, Arduino Mega.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides intuitive dashboards for data visualization and interaction.
  

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Python (for Flask backend)
- Git

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samarth49/AutoForestFinal.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AutoForestFinal
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
